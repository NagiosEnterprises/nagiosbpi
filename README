NagiosBPI
=========

## Nagios Business Process Intelligence

NagiosBPI is used to group important services together to form a cohesive unit. 
Say you have an apache cluster made up of four servers, and you want to monitor 
the health of the site they're hosting. If one of four servers goes down, 
is that really something you need to be warned about? Wouldn't you rather be warned 
when two go down?

That's what this plugin was made for!


Installation on Nagios XI
-------------------------

1. Download the zip file onto a machine that can access XI from the web interface.

2. **For upgrades**:
   
       cp /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/components/nagiosbpi/bpi.conf /tmp/bpi.conf

3. Go to the Admin->Manage Components page.

4. Upload the zip file using the upload tool on the page.

5. Execute the following commands on the server's console:

       chmod +x /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/components/nagiosbpi/set_bpi_perms.sh
       /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/components/nagiosbpi/set_bpi_perms.sh

6. Nagios BPI should now be accessible from the main-left menu of Nagios XI.


Installation on Nagios Core
---------------------------

1. Download the source code as a zip file and unzip it 
   into your `/tmp` directory on your Nagios server.

2. Copy the `nagiosbpi` folder from your unzipped location to inside of 
   your Nagios directory or your preferred location that is accessible 
   by your webserver. This location could be dependent on your linux 
   distribution, but for the following example we'll use 
   `/usr/local/nagios/share`.

       cd /path/to/n/nagiosbpi 

3. Execute the permissions script as the root user:

       chmod +x set_bpi_perms.sh
       ./set_bpi_perms.sh

4. Edit the contents of the `constants.conf` file to match your directory 
   locations. **Make sure to use absolute locations!**

5. Launch Nagios BPI from your web browser http://YOURSERVER/nagios/nagiosbpi.

6. Start creating new BPI groups using the built-in configuration tools.


Running a check for BPI Groups on Nagios XI
-------------------------------------------

Download and install the [BPI Wizard](http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Addons/Configuration/Configuration-Wizards/Nagios-Business-Process-Intelligence-%28BPI%29-Wizard/details) to create checks for your BPI groups.


Running a check for BPI Groups on Nagios XI
-------------------------------------------

1. Download the [check_bpi.php](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagiosbpi/master/nagiosbpi/check_bpi.php) script
2. Edit the `check_bpi.php` file to point to the directory location of the 'api_tool.php' file.  
   
     Example:

         #!/usr/bin/php 
         <?php
         $file = '/var/www/http_public/nagiosbpi/api_tool.php'; 
         include($file);

3. Copy this file to the directory of your nagios check plugins. (Example: `/usr/local/nagios/libexec/`)
4. Make sure the file is executable.

        chmod +x /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_bpi.php

5. In your `nagios/etc` directory, locate your `commands.cfg` and add the following definition:

        define command {
           command_name          check_bpi
           command_line          $USER1$/check_bpi.php $ARG1$
        }

6. Create a dummy host definition similar to the following:

        define host {
           host_name             bpigroups
           use                   generic_host
           display_name          BPI Groups
           check_command         check_dummy!0
           address               1.0.0.0
           register              1
        }

7. Create service definitions like the following, use the BPI Group ID as the argument.  
   This can by found my mousing over the group name in the web interface, or by finding the `define [groupID]` statement in your `bpi.conf` file.

        define service {
           host_name             bpigroups
           service_description   My BPI Group 
           use                   generic_service
           check_command         check_bpi!myBpiGroupID
           register              1
        }   

   A sample BPI group definitions:

     * This group contains services and another group:

            define MyStuff {
                title=My Stuff
                desc=This is a test group for Nagios BPI
                primary=1
                info=www.yourwebsite.com
                members=localhost;PING;&, 192.168.5.11;Ping;&, $YourStuff;&, 
                warning_threshold=2 
                priority=1 
                critical_threshold=3
            }

     * This is a group with only services:

            define YourStuff {
                title=Your Stuff
                desc=This is a group with services only 
                primary=1
                info=http://www.example.com
                members=localhost;HTTP;&, localhost;SSH;&, localhost;Swap Usage;&, 
                warning_threshold=0
                priority=1
                critical_threshold=3
            }
