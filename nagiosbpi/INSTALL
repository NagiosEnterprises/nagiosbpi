RUNNING A NAGIOS CHECK FOR BPI GROUPS 
=====================================

NAGIOS XI
=========
- Download and install the BPI Wizard to create checks for your BPI groups.
- http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Addons/Configuration/Configuration-Wizards/Nagios-Business-Process-Intelligence-%28BPI%29-Wizard/details


NAGIOS CORE
===========
- Download the check_bpi.php script
- http://exchange.nagios.org/components/com_mtree/attachment.php?link_id=2335&cf_id=29
- Edit the 'check_bpi.php' file to point to the directory location of the 'api_tool.php' file.  
- Example:

  #!/usr/bin/php 
  <?php
  $file = '/var/www/http_public/nagiosbpi/api_tool.php'; 
  include($file);
  ?>

-Copy this file to the directory of your nagios check plugins.  (Depends on distrubition)
-Make sure the file is executable

-In your nagios/etc directory, locate your commands.cfg and add the following definition:

define command {
       command_name                  		check_bpi
       command_line                  		$USER1$/check_bpi.php $ARG1$
}

-Create a dummy host definition similar to the following:

define host {
	host_name			bpigroups
	use				generic_host
	display_name			BPI Groups
	check_command			check_dummy!0
	address				1.0.0.0
	register			1
}

-Create service definitions like the following, use the BPI Group ID as the argument.  
-(This can by found my mousing over the group name in the web interface, or by finding the 'define [groupID]' statement in your bpi.conf file).  

define service {
	host_name			bpigroups
	service_description		My BPI Group 
	use				generic_service
	check_command			check_bpi!myBpiGroupID
	register			1
}

	title=My Stuff
	desc=This is a test group for Nagios BPI
	primary=1
	info=www.yourwebsite.com
	members=localhost;PING;&, 192.168.5.11;Ping;&, $YourStuff;&, 
	warning_threshold=2 
	priority=1 
	critical_threshold=3
	
	}

#this is a group with only services  
define YourStuff {
