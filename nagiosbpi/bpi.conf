##CONFIG SYNTAX RULES 
#Do not add comments inside of the definition statements
# define [groupID] - groupID must be alphanumeric characters with no spaces.  
#    This id is used internally by the program as well as for the check_bpi.php plugin  
# title - the display name for the bpi group (value is required)
# desc - a description for a bpi group (value is optional)
# primary - boolean (1 or 0), Primary/Top-Level groups are primary=1, subgroups are primary=0 
# info - link to internal or external webpage (value is optional)  
# members - a comma delineated list of members.  
#    For services, format is: <hostname>;<servicename>;<opt>,
#    For groups, format is:  $<groupID>;<opt>,   (DO NOT USE SPACES FOR THE groupID!!!)
#        the <opt> is an '&' or '|' character.  
#        '&' option after host:servicename means service is part of a CLUSTER
#    For clusters, 'critical' is only reached when ALL services in a cluster are NOT 'Ok'    
#       '|' option after host:servicename means it is an essential service for the group, 
#       example: a 'critical' service with an '|' option will cause a 'critical' state 
#       for the entire group.  				  
#
# warning_threshold - the number of problems a group reaches before going 'warning' 
# critical_threshold - the number of problems a group reaches before going 'critical'  
# priority - (1-3) this sets the display priority on screen, 1 being 'high priority'
#
